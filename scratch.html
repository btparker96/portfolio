    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Benjamin Parker</p>
        <h1> I love this heading because it was so easy to make </h1>
        <p> I love this paragraph. Its about how easy this first page was to build.
           I mean it was pretty easy, woah! The only thing more easy was creating
            the content on this page like this paragraph for example </p>
        <h2> I love this heading because it was easier than the first--copy and paste baby</h2>
        <p> I love this paragraph cuz its the first paragraph just copied and pasted here.
           Its about how easy this first page was to build.
           I mean it was pretty easy, woah! The only thing more easy was creating
            the content on this page like this paragraph for example </p>
        <p>Reasons I love this page:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cuz it was so easy, I need to make this the first point</li>
          <li><p>There really isn't another reason to have another bullet
             except to show how a paragraph can be nested in a list</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This list is the same as above but an ordered list</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Cuz it was so easy, I need to make this the first point</li>
          <li><p>There really isn't another reason to have another bullet
             except to show how a paragraph can be nested in a list</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Inline elements</h2>
    
        <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular wrod or phrase.</p>
        <p>Other times it is nice to make a <strong>bold</strong> word. Its kinda easy.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Other times you need to shout, yeah!</strong></em></p>
        <p>Something else you should know is that whitespace is condensed by html so if you want
          a line break you need to use a line break element like between this line <br> and this line </p>
        <p> This is however, different than using a break like this one between paragraphs</p>
        <hr>
        <p> Do you see the theme break. This will be better defined in css. </p>
        <h1>Links</h1>
        <p>This portion of the page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>
    
        <ul>
          <!--Add <li> elements here-->
          <li>Absolute links, like to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good
           resource for web developers.</li>
          <li>Relative links, like to our <a href="misc/extras.html">extras</a></li>
          <li>Root Relative links, that begin with a slash</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This example is about links and <a href="images.html">images</a>.</p>
